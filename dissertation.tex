\section{Need for In-Home Monitoring}
%-------------------------
The number of people aged 65 and older in the United States is expected to reach 89 million by 2050, double the number of United States citizens in the same age group in 2011 [cite]. As the elderly population continues to grow, so will the need to provide in-home care for the elderly. Elder care has traditionally been lacking qualified, certified practitioners and clinicians, and the demand for in-home health aides is very likely to exceed recruitment rates over this period of growth [cite]. This will result in a growing deficit of qualified healthcare workers for in-home care, which will require the development of new models of healthcare delivery.

One response to this deficit of personnel is to leverage eHealth technology to provide in-home healthcare. In a 2005 report, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined eHealth as the “cost-effective and secure use of information and communications technologies in support of health and health-related fields, including health-care services, health surveillance, health literature, and health education, knowledge and research” and resolved to encourage long-term strategic plans to develop e-Health resources, noting that advances in technology have raised expectations for healthcare [cite]. Since then, WHO has also formalized the idea of mobile-health, or mHealth, which is similar to eHealth but uses mobile technology. This includes in-home installation of sensors or imaging devices used to monitor patients with chronic illnesses [cite]. A recent survey of mHealth technology found that mHealth has been found as an effective way to monitor elderly patients suffering from dementia and cognitive disorders including screening for cognitive decline and promoting healthy habits in terms of physical activity [cite].

The need for in-home monitoring extends beyond caring for the elderly to monitoring individuals of any age who require assistance living independently due to a mental or physical disability or injury. In addition to the use of in-home monitoring for clinical purposes, it may be an important aspect of ubiquitous smart home systems. As more and more electronic devices are becoming internet-of-things (IoT)-enabled, including televisions, kitchen appliances, and security systems, the demand is growing for systems that automatically understand and react to users and their actions.


%-------------------------
\section{Activities of Daily Living}
%-------------------------
Activities of Daily Living (ADL’s) are defined as activities routinely performed in daily life, often for basic hygiene and personal care as well as food preparation, housekeeping, and other aspects of independent living. These activities have been studied since at least the 1960s [cite] as an assessment for the ability to perform physical self-maintenance, especially among the elderly. Several scales of assessment have been proposed, each with the common purpose of evaluating the cognitive and physical capabilities of the subject [cite]. In the clinical setting, it has been shown that the ability to independently perform ADLs is an indicator of the onset and progression of conditions such as Dementia and Alzheimer's disease [cite].

The manual assessment of human activities is dependent on the ability for the subject to be observed, necessitating the use of either in-home visits by a clinician or visits by the subject to clinical laboratories. This can be challenging when considering the expense of home visits and the limited ability of elderly to travel and coordinate appointments. The use of technology through eHealth and mHealth applications to monitor and observe ADLs in a home environment can greatly reduce the impact to both the subject and clinician by providing an unobtrusive, automated method of gathering activity data. [what to cite?]

A challenge to implementing automated activity detection and recognition systems is the need for a formalized model defining each activity under observation. The ability to recognize activities as they occur comes very naturally for humans, but it is much more difficult to define for a machine. Human activities are defined in overlapping temporal and semantic spaces. That is, one higher-level activity may include the performance of several lower-level activities at the same time. Thus the definition of these activities may be subjective to the observer. 

For example, a subject may perform the high-level activity of preparing breakfast, which involves many actions and movements in a sequence over a significant period of time. Within the action of preparing breakfast, the subject may have accomplished the lower-level activity of making toast, and within that activity the subject may have accomplished the lower-level activity of inserting bread into the toaster. The chain of activities may continue decomposing all the way down to the activity of picking up a bag of bread. Understanding the same or overlapping activities at all of these levels is crucial to a fully functioning activity monitoring system.


%-------------------------
\section{Research Goals}
%-------------------------
\emph{Research Question 1: Can wearable sensors be used to unobtrusively monitor activities of subjects in a semi-structured environment?}
A desired outcome of this work is to provide evidence that a system based on wearable sensors may be used in the home (i.e. not in a clinical setting or laboratory) to provide continuous monitoring of activities of daily living. The outputs of the system provide data on activities and patterns of activities to inform clinicians on possible changes in the health and wellness of the user. Data collected at clinical laboratories is temporally sparse and involves scripted movements, bringing into question the validity of the data for assessing the subject’s ability to perform the actions in a natural environment; by contrast, the data collected by in-home monitoring will show a more complete look into the subjects’ abilities to perform activities on a day-to-day basis.
Early work was focused on detecting and measuring gait in controlled and semi-controlled environments. While results were achieved with uninterrupted gait sequences of several meters, it was clear that long uninterrupted gait sequences are uncommon in many daily activities, which include starts and stops and navigation around household objects. For this reason, the ultimate focus of this work is on object interactions rather than gait, as object interactions provide a much richer context for activities that are being performed.

\emph{Research Question 2: Can features extracted from first-person videos recorded in subjects’ homes be used to categorize different interactions with objects?}
The use of object interactions to determine activities has been popular in recent automated activity recognition and classification systems [cite]. Many in-home ADL’s are at least partially defined by interactions with certain objects. For example, knowing that a subject is interacting with a remote control should reveal that the subject is interacting with a television or other electronic device. The search space of candidate activities can be greatly culled by knowing which objects are involved. A desired outcome of this work is to exploit a combination of video and object features to characterize different interactions with objects.
Building on an initial set of features from previous work with gait, an initial baseline set of features was identified for categorizing object interactions. In addition to the location of objects, this set of features was heavily dependent on optical flow features to identify changes in object location and color features to identify changes in the appearance of objects [cite]. Additional experiments are needed to extend and refine this set of features and the resulting Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) that was developed, but the initial work proved the feasibility of using first-person video features to categorize object interactions.

\emph{Research Question 3: Can the activity identification system handle uncertainty in the results better than current state-of-the-art methods?}
While much recent work has been done on using deep learning and neural networks to identify human activities in video sequences (such as run, walk, sit down, throw, turn on faucet, open refrigerator, etc.) [cite], there are two major drawbacks:
The networks must be trained to recognize a very specific set of actions. To date, most work involving neural networks has been against small sets of precisely defined and scripted activities.
Since deep learning requires no features to be identified/extracted, the use of these technologies in isolation provides no ability to explain the outcome – only to identify it. That is, when the network fails to provide the correct answer, there is no explainability of the result or the misidentified activity.
 
We propose the use of fuzzy logic to address these limitations. Many activities are very similar in their basic movements and absolute identification may become difficult as the set of activities grows. If an unknown activity occurs, fuzzy outputs may still provide some insight into the activity or similar activities. This is an advantage over machine learning approaches which will simply fail to identify the behavior. A fuzzy system will produce interpretable fuzzy variables describing actions in the scene in the course of attempting to identify an activity - for example, a specific object in the scene is being interacted with and the subject is manipulating the shape of the object. While the overall activity might be unidentified, a good amount of information may still be taken away from the fuzzy system.

\chapter{In The Beginning}
%=============================
The date of this document generation (current version of this document) is the date of the thesis on page two (\today).{}
sdafsd sadfsdaf asdfadf. OK, I have nothing to say here, but you should in your thesis/dissertation. Introduce your chapter in a page or so.

On a side note, style files should be located in the texmf tree automatically when a package is installed.  The sty-files used for this template are located in the folder \lq\lq{}sty\_files\_if\_needed\rq\rq{}.  If you do not have the packages already installed, you can also simply move or copy them into the same directory as this file.

%=============================
\section[Citations/References (short form of section name)]{Citations, using them, referring to them, formatting them, and loving using them because if you don't use them when appropriate it's called \emph{plagiarism}, and references}
%=============================
That was a ridiculously long section name to illustrate how to get a shorter version in your table of contents.

See Section~\ref{sec:equations}. I'm not the only one who says this is awesome stuff\cite{Mortara2004}!
This citation is in the ASME format for which I've included a \verb'bst'
file. See \textsc{asmems4} in the source document (way near the end). Some  other options are:
\begin{itemize}
\item natbib:  put \verb'\usepackage{natbib}' in the header (before \verb'\begin{document}'), and \verb'\bibliographystyle{plainnat}' (just before \verb'\bibliography').  See the natbib documentation for details.
\item AIAA:\@put \verb'\usepackage{overcite}' in the header (before \verb'\begin{document}'), and \verb'\bibliographystyle{aiaa}' (just before \verb'\bibliography'). Use \verb'\citen{sdfsdf}' for in-line citations. Read the overcite package documentation for more.
\end{itemize}

A variety of other formats are available on \href{http://www.ctan.org}{CTAN} or though an internet search. You may also just pick one using ``natbib''.\footnote{Don't those quotes look bad before ``natbib''? Well, use two left quotes in \LaTeX\ to get it to look right.}  The formatting of your references is controlled by the \verb'bibliographystyle' command near the end of the document. Use the bibliography style appropriate to your field. On exists, out there. I'm sure. If not (ok, it happened to me 10 years ago), you can use the \verb'makebst' script to make your own. Answer a bunch of questions and it makes a style file for you. If you are using a numerical citation system, you may want to use \verb'\usepackage{cite}'. It creates a condensed numerical list of citations, but can cause conflicts with the \verb'hyperref' package (you may need to decide\ldots sorry, this is a bug that drives me nuts too.)

%=============================
\subsection{About the Bibliography}
%=============================
There are two lines in this section in your \LaTeX\ file. The first is a bibligraphystyle command (see the \textsf{tex} file. Don't move it elsewhere. It won't work out well for you.

You need to choose a style file that formats references the way you want them formatted.  You should chose a style for your major.  Look for bst styles on ctan, or use makebst.sty. This formats the bibliography.
The last line is the bibliography command. It just tells \LaTeX\  the name of your \textsf{.bib} file. This is a database of your references.

Also, use the \verb'\phantomsection' command to correctly anchor the hyperlink for the bibliography.  Without this, any hyperlinks in the document, and the link from the bookmarks will take you to the incorrect page.

You can have as many sources listed in the *.bib file, but if you do not cite them in your document, they will not show up in your Bibliography.  And if you do, they automatically are sorted\ldots pretty nice!

%=============================
\subsection{Equations}\label{sec:equations}
%=============================
\begin{equation}\label{eq:alphaoverbeta} %You can name the label anything you want, just not the same as something else
x=\frac{\alpha}{\beta}
\end{equation}
Really bad idea: don't start a section with an equation. Don't start a sentence with a variable either. Start with a word. In the body of the text, use the \$ around the variable.  For example, the variable $x$ is the distance. How hard was that?

Sometimes you don't want an equation  number, so use \verb'{equation*}' instead.
\begin{equation*}
x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation*}

If you need to align a set of equations up use the \verb'align' command instead with the use of the \& to set the anchor
\begin{align}
x&=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\
x&=\frac{\alpha}{\beta}
\end{align}
The same applies for the \verb'align' command\ldots if you don\rq{}t want equation numbers,  just use an *.  More can be found at the references listed in Section~\ref{sec:refs}.  You can easily make matrices such as the viscous damping matrix, $C_d$, which is shown in Equation~\eqref{eq:damping_mat}.  Use the \verb'\eqref{eq:\ldots}' command to reference equations properly.
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:damping_mat}
C_{da} =[U_n^Tnn]^{-1}
\left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
a&b&c\\
	\ddots & 				& \\
	     	& 2 \zeta_i \omega_i 		& \\
		&				& \ddots \\
\end{array} \right]^{{-1}} [U_n]^{-1}
\end{equation}

We don't number equations in \LaTeX. \LaTeX\ does it for us. Label them with names (see the raw \LaTeX\ file).   Just don't put a space in the middle of a variable name.

Now if I have an equation that I want to be between paragraphs, unlike equation (\ref{eq:alphaoverbeta}), I put a blank line after the equation.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:anothersillyequation}
  x\neq y
\end{equation}

See  indent? But if I'm continuing the paragraph, don't put that blank line in
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:anothersillyequation2}
  x\neq y
\end{equation}
and there won\rq{}t be an indent.

If you want a new page and you have a figure you want to stay with the section, you need to use the \verb'\clearpage' command instead of the \verb'\newpage' command.

%=============================
\section{Figures}
%=============================
This is not the same as Section~\ref{sec:equations} on equations. However, if I move that section, I'll still be referring to the right section.
Better explained by Figure\footnote{a- Don't use footnotes.\ b- Capitalize the word ``Figure''}~\ref{fig:example}.  You can keep all of your figures in a sub-directory such as \lq\lq{}pix\rq\rq{}, which is used in this template.
\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{WSUThesisTemplate/pix/example.pdf} %
   \caption{Example caption.}
\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

The width of the figure can be set based on percentage of text width as set in Figure~\ref{fig:example} or based on inches as used in Figure~\ref{fig:example2}.  Also notice the \verb'\label' is after the \verb'\caption'.  This must be true, or the hyperlinks and figure numbers will not be correct.

%----------------------------------------------------------
\begin{figure}[!t] %forced to top of page so no text will be stranded above
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=3in]{WSUThesisTemplate/pix/example.pdf} %
   \caption[Short Figure Caption]{Example caption that is way too long for the list of figures, is a run on sentence, has no purpose being this long, except to show you how to avoid such a crazy long entry in your list of figures.}
\label{fig:example2}
\end{figure}
%----------------------------------------------------------

Don't ask me why the label command has to come late in a figure. It does.  Remember, color won't print well in black and white. Use dashes and dash-dots, etc, for hard copies. I'll document a trick for this later. Basically, make two graphics directories, one for color, one for black and white. Then, use the \textsf{graphicspath} command to choose the one you want. You can Google this for now.

%=============================
\section{Sub-figures}
%=============================
You can also make sub-figures and reference each of them individually.  You can reference the entire Figure~\ref{fig:1x2_subfigs}, or just Figure~\ref{fig:example_a} or Figure~\ref{fig:example_b}.
%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \subfigure[First sub-figure]{
\label{fig:example_a}
   \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{WSUThesisTemplate/pix/example.pdf}}
   \subfigure[Second sub-figure]{
\label{fig:example_b}
   \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{WSUThesisTemplate/pix/example.pdf}}
   \caption{Side-by-side sub-figures.}
\label{fig:1x2_subfigs}
\end{figure}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------


If you want 4 total figures, just add a line break, \verb'\\', after the second sub-figure as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:2x2_subfigs}.  You can add spacing between them with the \verb'\quad' or \verb'\qquad' commands.  There is more space between Figures~\ref{fig:example_2x2a} and~\ref{fig:example_2x2b} to show the use of this spacing.  Make sure all of your spacing is equal.  And don't make your figures too small.  As my advisor told me, ``old people read these''\cite{Mark}.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{figure}[!t]
   \centering
   \subfigure[First sub-figure]{
\label{fig:example_2x2a}
   \includegraphics[width=.25\textwidth]{WSUThesisTemplate/pix/example.pdf}} \quad
   \subfigure[Second sub-figure]{
\label{fig:example_2x2b}
   \includegraphics[width=.25\textwidth]{WSUThesisTemplate/pix/example.pdf}}\\
      \subfigure[Third sub-figure]{
\label{fig:example_2x2c}
   \includegraphics[width=.25\textwidth]{WSUThesisTemplate/pix/example.pdf}}
   \subfigure[Fourth sub-figure]{
\label{fig:example_2x2d}
   \includegraphics[width=.25\textwidth]{WSUThesisTemplate/pix/example.pdf}}
\caption{2$\times$2 sub-figures.}
\label{fig:2x2_subfigs}
\end{figure}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------

%=============================
\section{Including Chapters or Files}
%=============================
You can include chapters using the \verb'\include' command. See the \LaTeX\ file.  Each file can be included separately as to keep editing localized to each chapter.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
%\include{chapter2}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
%\include{chapter3}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also use the \verb'\input' command to include items without forcing a page break.  This becomes handy when generating a table, you can leave the reference in the main document and the table can be updated separately.
\input{WSUThesisTemplate/table_bench_tests}

Using the \verb'booktabs' package makes very professional looking tables by varying the thickness of the lines which can be customized.

%=============================
\clearpage \section{Inserting Code}
%=============================
If you want to insert code into your document by reference, instead of copy/paste, you even use the \href{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Source_Code_Listings}{listings} package.  

\href{http://www.mathworks.com}{Matlab} users may find the simpler interface of the \verb'mcode' package easier.  To do that simply comment the \verb'\usepackage{listings}' line near the top of this (the \verb'.tex') document and uncomment the preceding line. You can choose to between several options to frame, have numbered lines, automatic line breaks and more.  Below is an example of listing a MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} m-file.
